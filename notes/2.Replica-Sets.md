# Replica set

- Maintains a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time\


## When to use Replica Sets ?

- A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. 
- However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features. 
- Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or don't require updates at all.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # modify replicas according to your case
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:

      labels:

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
```
