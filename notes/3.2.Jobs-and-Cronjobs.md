# Jobs
- A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. 

- Example
```console
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

```console
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/job.yaml
```

## Parallel execution for Jobs
- Non-parallel Jobs
- Parallel Jobs with a fixed completion count
- Parallel Jobs with a work queue
