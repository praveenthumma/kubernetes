# Resource Requirements.
- When you specify a Pod, you can optionally specify how much of each resource a container needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory (RAM); there are others.
- The kube-scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod
-
- Default Minimum Requirement by Container
  - 0.5 CPU
  - 256 Mi Memory 
- 1 Block of CPU means 1 vCPU/Core  (AWS, AZURE, )or 1 Hyperthread 

# Requests and Limits
- If the node has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and allowed) for a container to use more resource than its __request__
- For example, if you set a memory request of 256 MiB for a container, amd the node has 8GiB of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use more RAM.
- If you set a memory __limit__ of 4GiB for that container, the kubelet (and container runtime) __enforce the limit__
- For example: When a process tries to exceed limits, the system kernel terminates the process, with an out of memory (OOM) error.
- kubernetes runtime tries to Throttle CPU so that it wont go beyond its limit , but when a container process exceeds its memory the proces is terminated.
