# Assigning Pods to Nodes

## Node Labels
- Like many other Kubernetes objects, nodes have labels
- Adding labels to nodes allows you to target Pods for scheduling on specific nodes or groups of nodes
- If you use labels for node isolation, choose label keys that the kubelet cannot modify

## Node Selector
- __nodeSelector__ is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint.
-  You can add the __nodeSelector__ field to your Pod specification and specify the node labels you want the target node to have.
-  Kubernetes only schedules the Pod onto nodes that have each of the labels you specify.

## Node Affinity
- Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector, allowing you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. 
- There are two types of node affinity:
  - __requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution__
    - The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax. 
  - __preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution__
    - The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod.
 - In the preceding types, __IgnoredDuringExecution__ means that if the node labels change after Kubernetes schedules the Pod, the Pod continues to run.
