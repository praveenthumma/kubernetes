# Volumes

## Persistant Volumes
- A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes
- It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource
-  PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV
## Persistant Volume Claims
-  request for storage by a user
-  It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources.
-  Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory)
-  Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany)

### Lifecycle of PVC
#### __Provisioning__ :There are two ways PVs may be provisioned: 
  - Statically
  - Dynamically.

##### **Static** :
- A cluster administrator creates a number of PVs. They carry the details of the real storage, which is available for use by cluster users. They exist in the Kubernetes API and are available for consumption.
