# Multi Container Pods


## Patterns
- Ambassidor
  - In the Kubernetes perspective, an Ambassador pattern implements a proxy to the external world.
- Adaptor
  - The adapter pattern helps you standardise something heterogeneous in nature.
  - youâ€™re running multiple applications within separate containers, but every application has a different way of outputting log files.
  - Now, you have a centralised logging system that accepts logs in a particular format only.
  - You use this container to homogenise the logs to an acceptable format.
- SideCar
  - An additional container to do jobs like exporting logs via log agent etc.



## InitContainers
- specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod
- You can specify init containers in the Pod specification alongside the containers array
- Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:
  - Init containers __always run to completion__.
  - Each init container must __complete successfully__ before the next one starts.
-  If a Pod's init container fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts that init container until it succeeds.
-  However, if the Pod has a restartPolicy of Never, and an init container fails during startup of that Pod, Kubernetes __treats the overall Pod as failed.__
-  Init containers do not support lifecycle, livenessProbe, readinessProbe, or startupProbe because they must run to completion before the Pod can be ready.
