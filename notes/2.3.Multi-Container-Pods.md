# Multi Container Pods


## Patterns
- Ambassidor
- Adaptor
- SideCar



## InitContainers
- specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod
- You can specify init containers in the Pod specification alongside the containers array
- Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:
  - Init containers always run to completion.
  - Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.
-  If a Pod's init container fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts that init container until it succeeds.
-  However, if the Pod has a restartPolicy of Never, and an init container fails during startup of that Pod, Kubernetes treats the overall Pod as failed.
-  Init containers do not support lifecycle, livenessProbe, readinessProbe, or startupProbe because they must run to completion before the Pod can be ready.
