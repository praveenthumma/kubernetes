### Deployment Strategy
- __Recreate__ :  
  - Bring down all pods at once and  create new ones.
  - scale down all pods to 0.
  - Application will have downtime
- __Rolling(Default)__ :
  - Take down older version and bring up newer version one by one.
  -  Zero downtime.

### Update image
```console
kubectl apply -f <deployment-definiton-file>

## Or 

kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment <container-name>=nginx:1.9.1
```

### Rollback
- Brings down the new replicaset and brings up the old replicas set
```console
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
```
