# Taints and Tolerations
- Node affinity is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). 
- Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.
- Taints are set on nodes and Tolerations are set on pods
- Tolerations are applied to pods.
- Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints. 
- Tolerations allow scheduling but don't guarantee scheduling: the scheduler also evaluates other parameters as part of its function.

## Taint
- You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint.

```properties
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
```

- To removew a taint
```console
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-
```
- 

### Taint Effects
- No Schedule 
  - Pods will not be scheduled on the node 
- PreferNoSchedule 
  - The system will try to avoid placing a Pod.
- NoExecute 
  - New pods cannot be scheduled and Existing pods will be evicted.

## Master node is tainted so that with NoSchedule so that no pods are deployed on them.
